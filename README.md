# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) & Problem Solving

Welcome to my DSA and Problem Solving repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing my journey in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms, as well as my problem-solving skills. Here, you'll find a collection of solutions to various coding problems, along with detailed explanations and code implementations.

## ðŸ“š About DSA

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts in computer science that help in organizing and processing data efficiently. Understanding DSA is crucial for optimizing code performance and solving complex problems effectively. Here's a brief overview:

### Data Structures
- **Arrays and Strings**: Basic structures for storing and manipulating collections of data.
- **Linked Lists**: Dynamic data structures that consist of nodes connected by pointers.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Structures that follow specific order principles (LIFO for stacks, FIFO for queues).
- **Trees**: Hierarchical structures used for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Graphs**: Structures representing pairwise relations between objects.

### Algorithms
- **Sorting and Searching**: Techniques to order and find data within structures.
- **Dynamic Programming**: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step.
- **Recursion**: Solving problems where the solution involves solving smaller instances of the same problem.

## ðŸ’» Problem-Solving Approach

In this repository, you will find solutions to various coding problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces. Each problem includes:
- **Problem Statement**: Description of the challenge.
- **Approach**: Explanation of the thought process and strategy used to solve the problem.
- **Code**: The implementation in Java.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Discussion of time and space complexity.
